/*
There are certain reserved words, called keywords, that have standard, predefined meanings in C. These
keywords can be used only for their intended purpose; 
they cannot be used as programmer-defined identifiers.


There are a total of 44 keywords in C (C89 – 32, C99 – 5, C11 – 7): 

auto        extern        short        while
break       float         signed        _Alignas
case        for           sizeof        _Alignof
char        goto          static        _Atomic
const       if            struct        _Bool
continue    inline        switch        _Complex
default     int           typedef       _Generic
do          long          union         _Imaginary
double      register      unsigned      _Noreturn
else        restrict      void          _Static_assert
enum        return        volatile      _Thread_local
