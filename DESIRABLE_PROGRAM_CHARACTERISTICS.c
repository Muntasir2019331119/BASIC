/*These characteristics apply to programs that are written in any programming language, not just C.

1. Integrity. This refers to the accuracy of the calculations. It should be clear that 
all other program enhancements will be meaningless if the calculations are not carried
 out correctly. Thus, the integrity of the calculations is an absolute necessity in any
  computer program.

2. Clarity refers to the overall readability of the program, with particular emphasis on its underlying logic.If a program is clearly written,
it should be possible for another 
programmer to follow the program logic without undue effort. It should also be possible 
for the original author to follow his or her own program after being away from the 
program for an extended period of time. One of the objectives in the design of
C is the development of clear, readable programs through an orderly and disciplined
 approach to programming.


3. Simplicity. The clarity and accuracy of a program are usually enhanced by keeping things as simple as
possible, consistent with the overall program objectives. In fact, it may be desirable to sacrifice a certain
amount of computational efficiency in order to maintain a relatively simple, straightforward program
structure.

4.Eficiency is concerned with execution speed and efficient memory utilization. These are generally
important goals, though they should not be obtained at the expense of clarity or simplicity. Many
complex programs require a tradeoff between these characteristics. In such situations, experience and
common sense are key factors.

5.Modularity. Many programs can be broken down into a series of identifiable subtasks. It is good
programming practice to implement each of these subtasks as a separate program module. In C, such
modules are written as functions. The use of a modular programming structure enhances the accuracy
and clarity of a program, and it facilitates future program alterations.

6. Generality. Usually we will want a program to be as general as possible, within reasonable limits. For
example, we may design a program to read in the values of certain key parameters rather than placing
fixed values into the program. As a rule, a considerable amount of generality can be obtained with very
little additional programming effort.
